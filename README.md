Python interpreter for Marbelous

Marbelous is an esoteric programming language based on numbered marbles falling down a Rube Goldberg like board full of devices that move and manipulate the marbles.

Creation of this language was inspired by conversation in the Programming Puzzles & Code Golf StackExchange [chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/240/the-nineteenth-byte), forked to a [dedicated chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/16230/marbelous-esolang-design) later.

Credit for the original idea goes to cjfaure.
Additional language design input from Martin BÃ¼ttner, Nathan Merrill, overactor, sparr, githubphagocyte, es1024, VisualMelon.

First versions of interpreter by sparr.

Example program (more in examples/):

    # calculates the nth fibonacci number, recursively
    I0 I0 I0 .. # three copies of I0, call them A B C
    -- S0 <2 O0 # decrement A, hold B for sync, return C if it's <2
    S0 -- <5 -- # hold A for sync, decrement B, divert and decrement C if it's <5
    -- MB S0 O0 # decrement A, recurse with B, release sync or return C-1
    MB .. \/ .. # recurse with A, do nothing with B, trash C
    \\ O0 .. .. # add A to B and return it
