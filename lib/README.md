Marbelous standard libraries
============================

Marbelous files in this directory are standard libraries meant to be included in other scripts.

The standard format for a library includes a main board that accepts one or more inputs and outputs results to stdout. All functionality to be imported to other scripts must be implemented in sub-boards.
