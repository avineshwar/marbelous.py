Marbelous examples
==================

Marbelous files in this directory are examples of what can be done with the language.

The standard format for an example includes a main board that accepts one or more inputs and outputs results to stdout. A sub-board should provide the demonstrated functionality, so that the example might be included in another mbl file.

The main board will typically take some input from the command line and send some output to stdout by including dec_out.mbl or hex_out.mbl to output decimal or hex values.
